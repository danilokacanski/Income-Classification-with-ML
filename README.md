# Income-Classification-with-ML
This project involves predicting whether an individual's income exceeds $50K annually using a dataset with various demographic and employment features.

This project focuses on predicting whether an individual's income exceeds $50K per year using the Adult Income dataset from Kaggle, which contains demographic and employment features such as age, education, marital status, and occupation. Non-numeric features were transformed into numeric dummy variables for effective model training. I applied machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression and random forests, and achieved an accuracy of 0.88. The model's performance was evaluated through metrics like accuracy and precision to ensure reliable predictions.
